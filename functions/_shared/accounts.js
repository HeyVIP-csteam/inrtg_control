/**
 * accounts.js  (SERVER-ONLY)
 *
 * Backs the TG Reply Threads account system: Offices (a name + a small
 * allowed-IP list) and Accounts (username/password/role/brand access,
 * each belonging to one Office). Stored in the same THREADS_KV namespace
 * as everything else in this feature, under their own key prefixes so
 * nothing collides with thread records:
 *
 *   office:<id>        → { id, name, allowedIPs: [...] }
 *   offices-index       → JSON array of office ids
 *   account:<username>  → { username, salt, hash, role, officeId, allowedBrands }
 *   accounts-index       → JSON array of usernames
 *
 * DESIGN NOTE — SESSION TOKENS (replaces the old "no session" model).
 *
 * SECURITY INCIDENT, 2026-07-20: the original design stored the agent's
 * PLAINTEXT password in the browser's localStorage (`agentAuth`) and
 * re-sent it on every request via X-Agent-User/X-Agent-Pass headers, so
 * every protected endpoint could re-verify the password hash + office IP
 * on every single call without a session store. This was found to be
 * trivially readable via browser DevTools (F12 → Application → Local
 * Storage) by anyone with physical/remote access to an already-logged-in
 * browser — i.e. the password was sitting in the clear, independent of
 * how strong the server-side hash was. Replaced with signed session
 * tokens:
 *   - On login, the server issues a signed token (HMAC-SHA256 over
 *     {username, tokenVersion, iat, exp} using the SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET
 *     env secret) — see issueToken()/verifyToken() below.
 *   - The browser stores ONLY this token (never the password) and sends
 *     it as X-Agent-Token on every request.
 *   - verifyToken() checks the signature + expiry; verifyRequest() then
 *     re-fetches the account and checks it's not locked AND that the
 *     token's `tokenVersion` still matches the account's current
 *     tokenVersion (bumped on every password change and every lock/
 *     unlock — see saveAccount()/setAccountLocked()), so a token that
 *     predates a password reset or a lock immediately stops working,
 *     same guarantee the old design had.
 *   - Tokens expire after TOKEN_TTL_MS regardless (hard ceiling on top
 *     of the client-side 2h idle timeout in authguard.js).
 * REQUIRES a new Cloudflare secret: SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET (any long
 * random string — used only to sign/verify tokens, never sent to the
 * browser). If unset, issueToken()/verifyToken() throw/fail closed
 * rather than silently signing with a guessable key.

// decides WHO you can act on (canManage(), defined per-endpoint), this
// decides WHICH admin-area sections an account can even see, and for the
// subset in EDITABLE_ADMIN_SECTIONS, whether it can also EDIT them (as
// opposed to just viewing).
//
// DEFAULTS ARE RANK-TIERED, not flat deny-all — an account whose
// allowedAdminSections/adminSectionEditAccess have never been explicitly
// touched inherits a default computed from ITS CURRENT rank (see
// defaultSectionsForRank()/defaultEditForRank() below):
//   agent      -> sees nothing (Reset Password is separate, ungated)
//   senior     -> createAccount only
//   admin      -> createAccount + whitelistIp, both VIEW ONLY
//   superadmin -> every section, fully editable
//   owner      -> unconditionally unrestricted (never even consults these
//                 fields — see the `role === "owner"` shortcuts below)
// This mirrors exactly what the old flat rank checks used to grant
// before this became a per-account choice, so turning this feature on
// doesn't silently strip existing SuperAdmins of access they already
// had, NOR does it silently hand an Agent/Senior more than they used to
// have. The instant an Owner (or a delegate — see
// canManageOthersAdminAccess() below) explicitly sets EITHER field on an
// account (even to an empty array), that concrete value wins forever
// after and stops following rank changes — a deliberate customization,
// once made, doesn't get silently reset by a later promotion/demotion.
//
// See functions/api/admin/{accounts,offices,routes}.js for where these
// gate the actual server-side actions, and public/index.html for the
// sidebar-visibility + Agent Profile checkbox UI this controls (which
// mirrors this same rank-tiered default logic client-side for rendering
// only — the server here is what's actually enforced).
// "bettingLinks" (2026-08) gates the HeyVIP Betting Rules hub card's
// admin panel (Account Management → Betting Resources Links — edits the
// link list at /betting-resources.html; see functions/api/admin/
// betting-resources.js). Deliberately NOT added to any bucket in
// defaultSectionsForRank()/defaultEditForRank() below, same treatment as
// every other section that only became SuperAdmin's-by-default when it
// was introduced — falling through to "rank >= superadmin -> all" is
// what makes it superadmin-and-above only out of the box, with Owner
// able to hand it to a specific lower-ranked account same as any other
// section. Browsing the resulting page itself is NOT gated by this at
// all — every logged-in agent can see it, this only controls who can
// edit the link list (see functions/api/betting-resources.js's plain
// verifyRequest() check vs this section's canSeeAdminSection() gate).
// "webLink" (2026-08) gates the per-brand "Pill Link" editor — the URL
// each brand's pill on the Home page's marquee row opens when clicked.
// Previously this had NO section gate at all (any logged-in agent could
// POST /api/brand-config — see that file's own history); it's now
// EDITABLE_ADMIN_SECTIONS-gated same as its Integration Portal siblings
// below. Falls through to "rank >= superadmin -> all" same as every

// individual access to tgRoutes/depositSheets/bettingLinks/webLink

// ITERATION COUNT — lowered this session, see below for why.
//
// This system has no session/token (see the design note above): every
// single request re-verifies the password from scratch via
// verifyPassword(), including every 6-second sidebar poll. Cloudflare
// Workers' Free plan caps CPU time at 10ms per request — and PBKDF2 at
// the OLD count (100,000 iterations) was landing right at or over that
// ceiling on every authenticated call, especially once you add the rest
// of the request's own JS work on top. Cloudflare's own docs flag
// exactly this: "heavier workloads that handle authentication... typically
// use 10-20ms" of CPU time on Free — this is a documented, known way to
// blow the Free plan's budget, not a misconfiguration on our end. When a
// request exceeds the CPU limit, Cloudflare kills the isolate at the
// platform level — that's NOT a catchable JS exception, so none of the
// try/catch safety nets added earlier this session could ever have caught
// it; it surfaces to the browser as a bare network-level 503, no JSON
// body, which matches exactly what showed up in testing.
//
// Lowering the iteration count directly cuts that CPU cost. Every
// EXISTING account's password hash was computed at the OLD count and
// will only ever verify correctly against that count — so instead of a
// single global constant, each account record stores the iteration count
// that was actually used for IT specifically (`iterations` field, added
// this session). New accounts / password resets from now on get the new
// lower count; every account created before this change keeps working
// unmodified, verified at the count it was actually hashed with. Nothing
// needs a forced password reset.
