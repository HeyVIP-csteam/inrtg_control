/**
 * threads.js  (SERVER-ONLY)
 *
 * Storage for the "TG Reply Threads" feature — tracks each form submission
 * that was sent to Telegram, plus every reply that lands in that Telegram
 * thread (via webhook) or is sent back out from the dashboard.
 *
 * Backed by Cloudflare KV (binding: THREADS_KV — see wrangler.toml).
 * Two kinds of keys:
 *   thread:<id>          → full thread record (JSON), with a lightweight
 *                           summary attached as this key's KV *metadata*
 *   msgid:<chatId>:<mid>  → thread id (string) — lets the Telegram webhook
 *                           find which thread a reply belongs to in O(1)
 *
 * NO SHARED "index" KEY ANYMORE. Every write used to also rewrite one
 * single `"index"` JSON blob (the sidebar's data source) — but Cloudflare
 * KV allows at most 1 write/sec to the SAME key, and every reply/submit/
 * solve-toggle/edit was hitting that one key, so concurrent agents could
 * genuinely 429 each other. Instead, each thread's own summary now rides
 * along as *metadata* on that thread's own `put()` — a different key per
 * thread, so two agents touching two different tickets never contend with
 * each other at all (only two edits to the exact same ticket in the same
 * second still could, which is a much smaller, much rarer surface). The
 * sidebar is built with `THREADS_KV.list({ prefix: "thread:" })`, which
 * returns every thread's metadata without fetching the full record —
 * cheap per-call, BUT Cloudflare's free plan caps `list()` at 1,000
 * calls/day, completely separate from (and far stricter than) the
 * 100,000 reads/day budget. A naive "call list() on every listThreads()"
 * (the original version of this redesign) blew through that in a
 * couple of hours of normal 6-second sidebar polling — see the
 * LIST_CACHE_KEY / LIST_CACHE_TTL_MS / DAILY_SCAN_LIMIT section below for
 * the fix (a real list() scan now only happens at most once every 2
 * minutes, cached in between, AND is hard-capped at 800 real scans per
 * UTC day no matter what). Keep this in mind before adding any OTHER list() calls
 * anywhere in this codebase — they all share the same 1,000/day budget.
 *
 * Trade-off: `list()` is only *eventually* consistent across Cloudflare's
 * edge (per Cloudflare's docs, propagation is usually fast but isn't
 * instant/global like a single-key read), so a brand-new ticket can take
 * a little longer to appear in someone else's sidebar than it used to.
 * Given the previous alternative was writes silently dropped/delayed
 * under contention, this is a straightforward trade in the sidebar's
 * favor. Any `thread:<id>` key saved before this change has no metadata
 * yet — `listThreads()` below transparently falls back to reading that
 * one thread's full record and re-saves it with metadata attached so it
 * only ever needs to do that once per pre-existing ticket. That healing is
 * capped per call (MAX_HEAL_PER_CALL, near listThreads() below) — right
 * after this ships, EVERY pre-existing ticket needs healing at once, and
 * Cloudflare caps how many subrequests one call can make, so healing them
 * all in a single call risked 503ing the whole page (this actually
 * happened during testing). The sidebar catches up over a few 6-second
 * polls instead — a one-time, self-resolving cost.
 *
 * AUTO-CLEANUP — controls how many KV "writes"/"deletes" you burn per day
 * (see the free-plan limits: 1,000 writes/day, 1,000 deletes/day). Adjust
 * the two numbers below to change how long tickets stick around; set
 * either to `Infinity` to disable that rule entirely. Cleanup runs
 * opportunistically (piggy-backing on normal reads), since Cloudflare
 * Pages Functions don't support Cron Triggers.

// ---- Cached sidebar scan ----
//
// Cloudflare's Workers KV free plan caps `list()` at 1,000 calls/day —
// completely separate from (and far lower than) the 100,000 reads/day
// budget, and NOT documented anywhere near as prominently. Every call to
// listThreads() used to run a real list() scan, and the sidebar polls
// every 6 seconds — do the math on ANY single agent leaving the
// dashboard open for a couple of hours and it's obvious this was always
// going to blow the daily list() quota, not a maybe. This is what
// actually caused the "Unexpected server error: KV list() limit
// exceeded for the day" failure that showed up in testing — a real
// architectural miss when the shared "index" key was first replaced
// with list()+metadata (that redesign fixed the KV *write*-contention
// problem, but nobody checked list()'s own separate, much stricter
// quota at the time).
//
// Fix: a real list() scan now only happens at most once every
// LIST_CACHE_TTL_MS — the result is cached in ONE KV key
// (LIST_CACHE_KEY) and every listThreads() call in between just reads
// that cache (a cheap get(), which draws from the 100,000/day read
// budget instead, with tons of headroom). 2 minutes keeps real list()
// calls to at most ~720/day even under continuous nonstop polling all
// day — comfortable headroom under 1,000, and also keeps the *write*
// side (saving the cache) well under the SEPARATE 1,000 writes/day
// budget, which every ticket submit/reply/solve-toggle also draws from.
//
// Trade-off, stated plainly: a brand-new ticket, or a solved/reopened
// status change, can now take up to ~2 minutes to show up in the
// sidebar for other agents (an already-open conversation stays fully
// real-time regardless — that's a direct-by-ID get(), never affected by
// any of this). Given the alternative was the whole sidebar hard-failing
// once the daily list() quota ran out, this is a straightforward trade
// in the sidebar's favor, same reasoning as the write-contention fix
// before it.
//
// Resilience: if a real scan fails (e.g. the daily list() quota is
// ALREADY exhausted for the day when this runs), fall back to whatever
// is cached — even hours-stale data — rather than fail the request
// outright. Only throws if there's truly nothing cached to fall back to.

// conditions — comfortably under Cloudflare's 1,000/day limit. But it's
// a "soft" guarantee: if several agents' polls land in the exact same
// instant right as the cache expires, each could independently decide
// "the cache is stale, I'll do a real scan" before any of them has
// written the refreshed cache back — a small, bounded race, not a
// guaranteed-zero one. This counter is the actual hard backstop the
// business owner asked for: an explicit daily count, stored in KV,
// checked BEFORE every real scan. Once it reaches DAILY_SCAN_LIMIT, no
// further real list() calls happen for the rest of the UTC day no
// matter what — the sidebar just keeps serving whatever's cached (even
// if that means it stops updating for the remainder of the day), which
// is a far better failure mode than risking a repeat of the outright
