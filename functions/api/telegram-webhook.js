/**
 * telegram-webhook.js
 *
 * Register this URL with Telegram once (from your own machine, not this
 * app — Telegram calls it, we don't call ourselves):
 *
 *   curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
 *     -d "url=https://inrtg-control.pages.dev/api/telegram-webhook" \
 *     -d "secret_token=<TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET>" \
 *     -d "allowed_updates=[\"message\",\"edited_message\"]"
 *
 * NOTE: if this webhook was registered before "edited_message" was added
 * to allowed_updates, Telegram will keep silently NOT sending edits until
 * you re-run the command above with the updated list — confirm with
 * https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo (allowed_updates
 * should include "edited_message").
 *
 * `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is a string you make up yourself (any random
 * value works) and set as a Cloudflare secret with that same name — it's
 * how we verify a request genuinely came from Telegram and not some rando
 * hitting this URL directly.
 *
 * Every message posted in the bot's groups (agent replies included) is
 * delivered here. Only a genuine, explicit reply gets matched — but that
 * now includes chains: a reply to our root ticket message, a reply to
 * THAT reply (e.g. someone @-tags another team who then replies), and so
 * on, as long as each link in the chain is an explicit reply to a message
 * we've already recorded. If that ticket was already marked Solved, an
 * explicit reply reopens it, since replying to it on purpose is a
 * deliberate signal. Anything else — a plain message typed in the topic
 * with no reply, Telegram's auto-attached "reply to the topic root" that
 * isn't a real reply, or a reply to some message outside this chain — is
 * intentionally ignored rather than guessed at, so a message never lands
 * on the wrong ticket.
